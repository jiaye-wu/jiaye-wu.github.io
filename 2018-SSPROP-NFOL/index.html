Unfortunately, in all but a few special cases, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation does not have analytic solutions, and must be solved numerically.</p> <p>SSPROP is a general-purpose symmetrized split-step software routine that can be invoked directly from Matlab to solve the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Unlike conventional Matlab scripts that are interpreted at runtime, SSPROP is a compiled program written in C that can be called directly from Matlab. It therefore retains the speed and efficiency of compiled program, while allowing access to the full range of Matlab graphing and vector manipulation routines. Benchmark tests show that the program is up to 10-20x faster than an equivalent Matlab m-file script that performs the same calculations.</p> <p>Original project is licensed under GPL v2.

Differential group delay, or polarization mode dispersion is likewise treated by making the second elements betapa(2) and betapb(2) different. (See note below for a more complete discussion.)The propagation constant can also be specified directly by replacing the polynomial argument betap with a vector of the same length as u0x.

This corresponds to a linearly-birefringent fiber whose axes are oriented at an angle χ with respect to the x-y axes.If psp is left completely unspecified, it assumes a default value of [0,0], which means that the fiber eigenstates are linearly polarized along the x- and y- directions.</p> <p><em>method</em>, string, String that specifies which method to use when performing the split-step calculations. The following methods are recognized “elliptical” or “circular”.When method = “elliptical”, sspropv will solve the equations by decomposing the input field into the (in general) elliptical eigenstates of the fiber. This method is appropriate only in fibers where the birefringent beat length is much shorter than the nonlinear length.When method = “circular”, sspropv will instead solve the equations by decomposing the input field into a right- and left-circular basis.

The dispersion can be specified to any polynomial order by using a betap vector with the appropriate length. In most cases the nonlinear Schrödinger equation is solved with a slowly-varing envelope approximation in a reference frame that is moving at the group velocity. In this case, the first two elements of the betap vector (β0 and β1) should be set to zero. The first non-zero term, betap(3), would then represent β2, the group-velocity dispersion.The propagation constant can also be specified directly by replacing the polynomial argument betap with a vector of the same length as u0.
