This simple and symmetrically designed optical structure operates upon continuous thermal sources in diurnal subtropical conditions, and its efficiency is much higher than natural cooling, for instance, when operating upon a typical 323.15 K continuous thermal source with a wind speed at 3 m/s, it can generate a net cooling power of 363.68 W/m², which is 18.26% higher than that of non-radiative heat exchange (natural cooling) under the same conditions. Additionally, several aspects are considered in its design to ensure a low cost in application, which is of great economical and environmental significance.</p> <h1 id="cited-as">Cited as</h1> <p>J.-Y.
