On **December 26th, 2023**, I was Invited by **The 2nd International Laser Forum for Young Scholars, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Machines (SIOM), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)** to present a talk on *Enhancement of linear and nonlinear thermo-optic effects by epsilon-near-zero conditions* at **SIOM, CAS, Shanghai, China**. {% cite Wu2024a Wu2024b %}

This talk was based on my recent publication in [*Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45054-z).
