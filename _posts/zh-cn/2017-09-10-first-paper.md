2015年4月1日是我开始选择创新班导师的日子。在戴峭峰 副研究员的指导下，我与团队完成了我的第一项科学研究，其摘要如下：

In this paper, an optical radiative cooler with quasi-Cantor structure is theoretically proposed and analyzed. This simple and symmetrically designed optical structure operates upon continuous thermal sources in diurnal subtropical conditions, and its efficiency is much higher than natural cooling, for instance, when operating upon a typical 323.15 K continuous thermal source with a wind speed at 3 m/s, it can generate a net cooling power of 363.68 W/m², which is 18.26% higher than that of non-radiative heat exchange (natural cooling) under the same conditions. Additionally, several aspects are considered in its design to ensure a low cost in application, which is of great economical and environmental significance. {% cite Wu2017a %}
