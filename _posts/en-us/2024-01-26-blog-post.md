Following the publishing of our recent work at _Nature Communications_ entitled [_Thermo-optic epsilon-near-zero effects_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45054-z), Springer-Nature invited us to write a behind-the-paper blog post, which is a version of the research for the general public. {% cite Wu2024a Wu2024b %}
