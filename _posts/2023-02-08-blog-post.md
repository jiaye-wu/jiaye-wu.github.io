As [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) decided to retire their reference management tool **Mendeley Desktop** and replace it with the immature [Mendeley Reference Manager](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/reference-manager) that is missing many important functions, more and more users complain about its user-unfriendly-ness (For example, see discussions on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mendeley/comments/10gfzoq/mendeley_reference_manager_is_a_horrible_program/)). I also have an answer below a [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/380051419/answer/1508753929) question sharing the archive of old Mendeley desktop installers that received a large amount of likes.

I am sharing the old installers for free as an internet archive, hosted in my Github repository. Please keep in mind that the copyright belongs to Mendeley, and I hold no responsibility for data lost or any damage caused by incorrect installation.
