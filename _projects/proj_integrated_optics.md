Aiming to replace the electronic universal computing as its destiny, the integrated optics has gone a long way. Various kinds of materials, such as silicon, silicon nitride, silicon carbite, lithium niobate, aluminium nitride, etc., are extensively studied. Here we focus on these aspects in this field:

1. introducing novel optical phenomena and materials into integrated photonics
2. investigating the essential/critical prerequisites before (large-scale) photonic integration
3. introducing techniques in the state-of-the-art microelectronics into on-chip photonic integration
4. realizing theoretical works that have great potential yet overlooked. 

An example of the 1st point: we introduced the novel *temporal Talbot effect of dark pulse trains* {% cite Wu2022a %} into integrated optics {% cite Wu2023 %}.

One example of the 2nd point is the enhanced thermo-optic effects in epsilon-near-zero materials {% cite Wu2024a %}, which are also CMOS-compatible (see [near-zero-index nonlinear nanophotonics project]({% link _projects/proj_enz_photonics.md %})).
Introducing the state-of-the-art microelectronic technique can lead to unexpected interesting new findings, for instance, we applied the supercritical fluid technique to degenerate semiconductor photonic material for the first time {% cite Wu2021b %}.
We also aim to employ our early theoretical works (see [publications](/publications/)) into **integrated nanodevices (nanostructure, thin-film device, metasurface), chips (hybrid & novel materials), and circuits (networks with certain topology)** with our newly developed technique and in collaboration with our sister labs and colleagues around the world.
