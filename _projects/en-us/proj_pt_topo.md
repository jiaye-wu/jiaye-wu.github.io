Inspired by the classic quantum mechanics and the electric trasmission line, a network of wave-guiding media can present optical properties qualitively and quantatively different from their components.

The studies have two branches, namely the non-Hermitian or parity-time symmetric ($$\mathcal{PT}$$-symmetric) {% cite Li2020 Zhi2018 Wu2019f Jia-YeWu2019 Wu2017%} and the classical dielectric {% cite Wu2019 %}.
They are both good candidates in the project [novel integrated photonic nanodevices, chips, & circuits]({% link _projects/en-us/proj_integrated_optics.md %}).
