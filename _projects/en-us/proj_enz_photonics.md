Photonic media with near-zero refractive index exhibits various extraordinary linear and nonlinear properties {% cite Wu2021 %}.
Our studies can be sorted into four categories, namely,

1. **fabrication**: fabrication methods, protocols, and for special needs (e.g., {% cite Huang2023 Wu2021b%}).
2. **integration**: prerequisite studies, design references, and hybrid integration (e.g., {% cite Wu2024a Sha2022%}).
3. **new phenomena**: new linear and nonlinear phenomena that has great potential (e.g., {% cite Wu2024a Wu2022 Wu2021a %}).
4. **applications: nano- and integrated devices**: useful for photonic computing, telecommunications, optical signal processing, etc (e.g., {% cite Xie2020a Sha2022 Xie2022 Sha2021%}).

We also aim to develop and introduce new techniques {% cite Wu2021b Wang2021 Huang2022%} in a multi- and inter-disciplinary way, and are active on theories and simulations {% cite Wu2021b Wu2020a%}.
