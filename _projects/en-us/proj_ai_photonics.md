Photonics involves the manipulation of light to create advanced technologies for communication, sensing, and imaging. Traditionally, designing photonic components, such as waveguides, filters, and lasers, relied heavily on trial-and-error methods and expert intuition. However, with the advent of AI, these processes have become more efficient and streamlined. AI-driven tools enable generative design approaches, where the system autonomously explores a vast design space, producing innovative solutions that push the boundaries of traditional photonic design. As a result, the collaboration between AI and photonics is paving the way for the development of next-generation optical technologies, enhancing capabilities across various applications, for example, from telecommunications to medical diagnostics.

We are working in the following categories:

1. **algoritm-assisted photonic designs**: structural designs and optimizations (e.g., {% cite Wu2020d Wang2021 Huang2022%}).
2. **inverse design**: novel design for optical signal processing and transformations.
3. **machine learning with physical constraints**: computational photonics with faster speed and predictions.
4. **photonic design for computations and neural networks**: photonic-enabled AI platforms (e.g., {% cite Wu2022%}).
