Photonic radiative cooling is a passive cooling technology that leverages the principles of photonics to dissipate heat by emitting infrared radiation. This approach involves designing materials or structures, often with engineered photonic properties, that can radiate thermal energy at specific wavelengths (usually in the mid-infrared range) directly into outer space. By optimizing these materials to have high emissivity in the atmospheric transparency window (8-13 micrometers) and low absorption in the solar spectrum, they can achieve cooling below ambient temperatures without consuming energy. Photonic radiative cooling has promising applications in building energy efficiency, outdoor equipment cooling, and even enhanced thermal management for photovoltaic cells.
