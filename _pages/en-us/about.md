## biography

Jiaye is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Photonic Systems Laboratory (PHOSL), Institute of Electrical and Micro Engineering (IEM), School of Engineering (STI), <img src="/assets/img/university_logos/EPFL.png" style="height: 0.8em; ">[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). His expertise and current research interests span ultrafast light-matter-interactions, nonlinear optics and nanophotonics in epsilon-near-zero materials, fibre, fibre laser, and waveguide network design, functional thin film design, and non-Hermitian optics. He received Ph.D. degree in Photonics from <img src="/assets/img/university_logos/EPFL.png" style="height: 0.8em; ">[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/) in 2025 with early graduation (first in the lab), M.Sc. degree in Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics (Integrated Photonic Devices) from <img src="/assets/img/university_logos/PKU.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">[Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2021 with the highest honours, and B.Sc. degree in Opto-Electronics Information Science and Engineering (Xiangqin Creative Class for Optoelectronics) from <img src="/assets/img/university_logos/SCNU.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">[South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/) in 2018 with distinction. Throughout his academic trajectory, he has consistently exemplified a commitment to outstanding scholarship. His prolific publications include 40+ academic papers (incl. 17+ as first/corresponding author) in peer-reviewed esteemed journals such as _Nature Communications_, _Laser & Photonics Reviews_, _ACS Photonics_, _Communications Physics_, etc. He served as a peer-reviewer for _Laser & Photonics Reviews_, _ACS Photonics_, _Communications Physics_, etc., and a co-reviewer for _Nature_, _Light: Science & Applications_, etc. He is an active member of <img src="/assets/img/post_covers/Elsevier.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">Elsevier Advisory Panel, <img src="/assets/img/post_covers/OPTICA.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">OPTICA (formerly OSA, the Optical Society) and <img src="/assets/img/post_covers/IPS.jpeg" style="height: 1.1em; ">IEEE Photonics Society. He was the founding president of <img src="/assets/img/post_covers/IPS.jpeg" style="height: 1.1em; ">IEEE Photonics Society PKUSZ branch chapter and the president of <img src="/assets/img/post_covers/OPTICA.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">OSA PKUSZ chapter.

## research Interests

Ultrafast light-matter-interactions, nonlinear optics and nanophotonics in epsilon-near-zero materials, fibre, fibre laser, and waveguide network design, functional thin film design, and non-Hermitian optics. Integrated optics of silicon nitride, transparent conducting oxides.

**Call for collaboration:** Cross- and multidiscipline research on semiconductor optics (micro- nano-devices), electro-optic integration, MEMS, photonics-related lab-on-a-chip; biophotonics; photonic computing; smart photonic design (AI for photonics) and photonic design for AI.
