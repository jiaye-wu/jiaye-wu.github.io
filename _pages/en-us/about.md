biography
------------

Jiaye is currently a PhD researcher and doctoral assistant at Photonic Systems Laboratory (PHOSL), Institute of Electrical and Micro Engineering (IEM), School of Engineering (STI), <img src="/assets/img/EPFL.png" style="height: 0.8em; ">[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). His expertise and current research interests span ultrafast light-matter-interactions, nonlinear optics and nanophotonics in epsilon-near-zero materials, fibre, fibre laser, and waveguide network design, functional thin film design, and non-Hermitian optics. He received M.Sc. degree in Microelectronics and Solid-State Electronics (Integrated Photonic Devices) from <img src="/assets/img/PKU.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">[Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) in 2021 with the highest honours, and B.Sc. degree in Optical Information Science and Technology (Xiangqin Optoelectronic Creative Class) from <img src="/assets/img/SCNU.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">[South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/) in 2018 with distinction. Throughout his academic trajectory, he has consistently exemplified a commitment to outstanding scholarship. His prolific publications include 20+ academic papers (incl. 16+ as first author and 3 as corresponding author) in peer-reviewed esteemed journals such as *Nature Communications*, *Laser & Photonics Reviews*, *Communications Physics*, *Photonics Research*, *ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces*, etc. He served as a peer-reviewer for *Communications Physics*, *Optics Express*, *Optics Letters*, *Optics & Laser Technology*, etc., and a co-reviewer for *Nature*, *Light: Science & Applications*, etc. He is an active member of <img src="/assets/img/Elsevier.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">Elsevier Advisory Panel, <img src="/assets/img/OPTICA.png" style="height: 1.1em; ">OPTICA (formerly OSA, the Optical Society) and <img src="/assets/img/IPS.jpeg" style="height: 1.1em; ">IEEE Photonics Society.
